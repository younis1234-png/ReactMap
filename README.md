Recently I worked on Airbnb Clone, one of the challenges I had was trying figure out how to display a rental location on the map.

After reading about #mapbox API, I created a simple map using ReactJs to display skateBoard parks locations in Ottawa!
Now, I can apply these skills to build the map for my Airbnb clone üèò
